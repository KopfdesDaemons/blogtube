== Description ==

Blogtube is a modern theme for blogs. A core feature is swapping layouts. 
The primary color is customizable. It has a tidy, wide layout with a sidebar,
which is right at the edge and doesn't get in the way. The author page is
particularly extensive. There is a landing page with a widget area.
